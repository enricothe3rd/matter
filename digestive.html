<h2 class="lesson">Lesson: The Different Organs of Digestion</h2>

<div class="intro-container">
<p class= "intro">The digestive system involves several organs working together to break down food into smaller molecules that can be absorbed by the body. These organs include the salivary glands, mouth, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, and large intestine. Each organ plays a specific role in the process of digestion, with the small intestine being the site of most nutrient absorption, and the large intestine being responsible for absorbing water and electrolytes from waste products. Overall, the digestive system ensures that the body receives the nutrients it needs from food and eliminates waste products efficiently.

        <img style="float:right;" src="salivary.png" alt="me" width="500px" height="300px"></a>
<p> The salivary glands are located in the mouth and produce saliva, which is a mixture of water, mucus, and enzymes. The enzymes in saliva, such as amylase, help to break down carbohydrates in food, while the mucus helps to lubricate food, making it easier to swallow. There are three pairs of major salivary glands: the parotid, submandibular, and sublingual glands. These glands are controlled by the autonomic nervous system and produce more or less saliva depending on the type of food and the body's needs.</p>

  <p> The pylorus is the narrowest part of the stomach that connects to the duodenum, which is the first part of the small intestine. The pylorus acts as a gatekeeper, controlling the release of food from the stomach into the small intestine. It does this by contracting and relaxing its muscles, which regulates the rate at which food is released. The pylorus also contains cells that secrete hormones and enzymes that help to control stomach emptying.</p>

      <h2 >6. Small intestine </h2>
  
      <div class="container">
  <p>  The small intestine is a long, narrow tube where most of the nutrients from food are absorbed into the bloodstream. The walls of the small intestine are lined with tiny projections called villi and microvilli, which increase the surface area available for absorption. The small intestine is divided into three parts: the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The duodenum is where most of the digestive enzymes from the pancreas and bile from the liver and gallbladder are released.

  <p>  The duodenum is the first part of the small intestine and it receives partially digested food from the stomach. It is the place where the enzymes from the pancreas and bile from the liver and gallbladder are released into the digestive tract. These enzymes and bile help to further break down the food into small enough particles that can be absorbed by the body. The duodenum also has a role in regulating the release of digestive juices and hormones from the pancreas and other organs, which are important for proper digestion and nutrient absorption.</p>

      <h2 >Jejunum</h2>
  
      <div class="container">
  <p>  The jejunum is the middle part of the small intestine and it is responsible for most of the absorption of nutrients from the digested food. The walls of the jejunum are lined with finger-like projections called villi, which increase the surface area available for nutrient absorption. The villi also contain tiny blood vessels and lymphatic vessels, which help to transport the absorbed nutrients into the bloodstream and lymphatic system.</p>

  <p>The ileum is the final part of the small intestine and it is responsible for absorbing any remaining nutrients from the digested food. It also absorbs vitamin B12 and bile salts, which are recycled back to the liver and gallbladder for reuse. The ileum connects to the large intestine (colon) at the ileocecal valve, which prevents backflow of fecal matter from the colon into the ileum. The ileum also has an important role in the immune system, as it contains Peyer's patches, which are lymphoid tissue that help to protect the body against harmful microorganisms.</p>

      <h2 >8. Gallbladder </h2>
  
      <div class="container" id="gallbladder">
  <p> The gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ located beneath the liver on the right side of the abdomen. Its main function is to store and release bile, a fluid produced by the liver that helps to digest fats in the small intestine. When food is eaten, the gallbladder contracts and releases bile into the small intestine to help break down fats. If the gallbladder is removed, bile flows directly from the liver to the small intestine. The gallbladder can be affected by various conditions, including gallstones, inflammation, infection, and cancer. Symptoms of gallbladder problems may include pain in the upper right abdomen, nausea, vomiting, and fever. Treatment may involve medications, dietary changes, or surgical removal of the gallbladder.</p>

      <h2 >9. Pancreas </h2>
  
      <div class="container">
  <p> The pancreas is a glandular organ located behind the stomach. It produces digestive enzymes, such as amylase, protease, and lipase, which are released into the small intestine to help break down carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. The pancreas also produces hormones, such as insulin and glucagon, which regulate blood sugar levels.</p>

          <img style="float:right;" src="head.jpg" alt="me" width="500px" height="300px"></a>
  <p> The head of the pancreas is the widest part of the organ, located on the right side of the abdomen. It's positioned within the C-shaped curve of the duodenum, which is the first part of the small intestine. The head of the pancreas is important because it contains the pancreatic ducts that carry digestive enzymes and bicarbonate to the small intestine. The head of the pancreas is also the site where the bile duct and pancreatic duct join together before emptying into the small intestine.</p>

      <h2 >10. Large Intestine </h2>
  
      <div class="container">
  <p>  The large intestine, also known as the colon, is a tubular organ that forms the final part of the digestive system in vertebrates. It is located in the abdominal cavity and connects the small intestine to the anus. The large intestine is wider and shorter than the small intestine and is responsible for absorbing water and electrolytes from the remaining indigestible food matter, producing and storing feces until elimination from the body through the rectum and anus.</p>

 <div class="summary">
  <h3>Summary</h3>
 <p>The digestive system comprises the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, rectum, and anus, which work together to break down food and absorb nutrients. The process of digestion starts in the mouth, where teeth and saliva mechanically and chemically break down food. The food then passes through the esophagus to the stomach, which mixes and grinds it into chyme. The small intestine is where most of the nutrients from food are absorbed into the body, with the help of digestive enzymes produced by the pancreas and liver. The large intestine absorbs water and electrolytes, forming feces, and stores it in the rectum until it is eliminated through the anus.</p>
